**Catsweeper** is a cozy, bathhouse-themed reimagining of the classic Minesweeper. 

My love of Minesweeper is only capped by the not-so-pleasant looks of the current clones out there. The ones that look alright don't feel good to play.  Made for my fellow minesweeper lovers who want something that feels good the play and also looks pretty!
